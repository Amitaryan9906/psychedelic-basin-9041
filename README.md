Tender Management System
Domain Description
The Tender Management System is designed to streamline the process of floating tenders and managing bids for a company. The system allows for the creation and management of an empaneled list of vendors who are eligible to bid on tenders. Vendors can only submit one bid per tender and the company can select the most suitable bid and place an order with the chosen vendor.

Users
There are two types of users in the system:

Administrator: The administrator is responsible for managing the system, including registering new vendors, creating new tenders, and viewing all vendors and tenders. The administrator can also view all bids for a tender and assign the tender to a vendor.

Vendor: Vendors can view all current tenders, place bids, view the status of their bids, and view their bid history.

Getting Started
To begin using the Tender Management System, an administrator must first register new vendors by assigning them a username and password. The vendor can then log in to the system and view all current tenders, place bids, and view the status of their bids and bid history. The administrator can also create new tenders and view all vendors and tenders in the system.
